Icon sizes:
You should always provide a 128x128 icon; it's used during installation and by
the Chrome Web Store. Extensions should also provide a 48x48 icon, which is
used in the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). You can also
specify a 16x16 icon to be used as the favicon for an extension's pages.

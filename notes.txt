Check https://openai.com/blog/sora-first-impressions to see if we can attach to the videos:
- When a button is clicked, it loads an iframe inside a div
- That iframe has divs etc. containing the video
- Wait, the `left-0` div already has the iframe (and the video), so why are we not attaching?

Icon sizes:
You should always provide a 128x128 icon; it's used during installation and by
the Chrome Web Store. Extensions should also provide a 48x48 icon, which is
used in the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). You can also
specify a 16x16 icon to be used as the favicon for an extension's pages.

2025-10-10 - why is it stuck while it should follow "audio"?
- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-general-purpose-amazon-ec2-m8a-instances-are-now-available/

2025-09-05 | A case for audio: https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/
- Keeps changing its source, so spy div is being added constantly
- Location of the controller is off because the element has no [good] dimension

Progress:
- Trying to go through inject.js and bring in functions.
- Created a class as VideoController (will contain VideoWrapper objects).
  * VideoWrapper class TBD...
- Trying to implement initializeNow

- 2025-07-24 | ignored https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed/commit/f573d2be because I'm
               honestly not sure what it's trying to do and whether it applies to me or not!
               I haven't noticed "keyboard shortcuts not persisting after refresh"

Check https://openai.com/blog/sora-first-impressions to see if we can attach to the videos:
- When a button is clicked, it loads an iframe inside a div
- That iframe has divs etc. containing the video
- Wait, the `left-0` div already has the iframe (and the video), so why are we not attaching?

Icon sizes:
You should always provide a 128x128 icon; it's used during installation and by
the Chrome Web Store. Extensions should also provide a 48x48 icon, which is
used in the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). You can also
specify a 16x16 icon to be used as the favicon for an extension's pages.
